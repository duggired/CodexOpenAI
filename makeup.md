i will do makeup in tampa area[indian bridal], how to share my contact to hotels or resort managers to sharemy contact if clients asks
To share your contact information with hotels and resort managers for client referrals in the Tampa area, the most effective approach is to establish professional relationships with their event coordinators and concierges, provide your professional information directly, and aim to become a preferred vendor. 
Strategy: Building Partnerships
Identify Key Contacts: Research hotels and resorts in the Tampa area that cater to weddings and special events, especially those that might host Indian weddings. Look for the names of their wedding/event planners, catering managers, or concierge managers.
Initial Outreach (Email): Send a concise, professional, and personalized email.
Introduce yourself and your specialization (Indian bridal makeup).
Briefly explain how your services can benefit their clients (e.g., "I provide specialized Indian bridal makeup services that ensure your guests have a seamless and luxurious experience").
Attach or link to a professional media kit that includes a link to your high-quality portfolio, price sheets, and testimonials.
Include a clear call to action, such as requesting a brief meeting or call to discuss potential collaboration.
In-Person Follow-Up: After sending the email, a personal touch makes a difference. Visit the hotels/resorts in person, introduce yourself to the front desk staff and management, and leave a few unique, professional business cards or a small, branded "info packet".
Offer Value and Incentives: Make it a win-win.
Offer mutual referrals: Propose cross-promotion where you refer their venue to your clients, and they do the same for you.
Provide a commission or finders' fee: Some hotels might be more inclined to refer you if there is a small incentive for them or a discount for the client they refer.
Host a workshop or offer a trial: Consider offering a complimentary makeup trial to the hotel's event coordinator or a small, informal workshop to their staff to showcase your expertise.
Become a "Preferred Vendor": Inquire about their process for becoming a "preferred vendor". Hotels often maintain a list of trusted suppliers (photographers, florists, makeup artists) they recommend to their clients. Getting on this list is a key goal.
Network with Other Vendors: Build relationships with other wedding professionals in the Tampa area like photographers, hair stylists, and wedding planners. They often refer makeup artists to hotels and clients, building a strong referral engine.
Maintain the Relationship: Follow up consistently without being pushy. Send a polite email every few months with updated work or new seasonal promotions to stay top of mind.

how to identify the resorts or hotls contact to send
To identify the specific contacts at hotels and resorts in the Tampa area, you should use the following multi-pronged approach:


contiune
To identify the specific hotels and resorts contacts in the Tampa area, use the following methods:
1. Utilize Official Hotel Websites 
The most direct way to find contacts is through the official websites of the hotels and resorts. 
Target the Right Page: Look for "Contact Us," "Meetings & Events," "Weddings," or "Plan Your Event" sections.
Identify the Manager: These pages often list specific email addresses or phone numbers for the sales and events team (e.g., "eventsales.tpa@editionhotels.com").
Look for Names: Scan the page for titles like "Event Manager," "Catering Manager," "Wedding Coordinator," or "Director of Events." This gives you a specific person to address in your email.
General Phone Number: If a direct email isn't available, call the main hotel number and ask the receptionist for the name and email address of the Wedding or Event Coordinator. 
2. Use Professional Networking Sites (LinkedIn)
LinkedIn is an excellent tool for finding specific people within an organization.
Search by Company: Go to LinkedIn and search for the specific hotel or resort.
Filter by People: Once on their company page, click on the "People" tab.
Use Job Titles as Keywords: Search within their employees for titles such as "Event Coordinator," "Event Manager," "Catering Sales Manager," "Director of Events," or "Wedding Specialist" in the Tampa area.
Connect Professionally: Once you find the right person, you can connect with them and send a brief, professional message. 
3. Leverage Wedding and Event Planning Directories
Websites catering to wedding planning often list venues and their affiliated event planners. 
Targeted Directories: Use sites like WeddingWire, The Knot, Eventective, or PartySlate.
Find "Preferred Vendor" Lists: Many venues on these sites provide lists of "preferred vendors" (like you want to become). You can connect with those existing vendors to network and sometimes find event manager details.
Venue Profiles: Check the venue's profile page on these sites; they sometimes list a direct contact or link to their event planning page. 
4. Consult Local Convention & Visitors Bureaus (CVB)
Organizations like Visit Tampa Bay offer resources for event planners and sometimes list contacts or information on local venues.
Visit Tampa Bay Website: Their "Meeting Planners" or "Suppliers" sections might have a list of venues and potentially some contact information.
Networking Events: These organizations often host networking events where you can meet hotel and resort staff in person. 
5. Utilize Search Engines
A targeted Google search can sometimes yield quick results.
Specific Queries: Use searches like:
"JW Marriott Tampa Water Street" "event manager email"
"The Don CeSar" "wedding coordinator contact"
"Hotel Flor Tampa" "catering manager"
By using a combination of these methods, you can build a targeted list of contacts for a more effective and personalized outreach.
